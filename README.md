"FlaskStore" is an online store developed as a personal project that highlights my expertise in full-stack development. I used Python with Flask for the backend and MySQL for database management. On the frontend, I designed an attractive interface with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, in addition to implementing asynchronous functions with JavaScript and Ajax to improve the user experience, such as dynamic product search.

The application has features such as user authentication, session management, interactive shopping cart and specific functionalities for registered users, such as wish list and purchase history. The store is organized by product categories for easy browsing and searching. In summary, "FlaskStore" is a complete project that demonstrates my skills in web and backend development creating functional and attractive applications for users.

It is worth mentioning that the project is under development.
